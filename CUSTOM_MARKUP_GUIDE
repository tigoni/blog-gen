* What is Haskell?
Haskell is a general purpose programming language which provides a functional approach to programs, uses 
lazy evaluation on expressions and is strongly typed.

* FEatures:
- Functional
- Lazy Evaluation
- Strong Typing

* Examples of a Haskell function:

> add :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
> add a b = a + b

Compiling the above in a file named Add.hs produces:
# add.hi
# add.o
# add
