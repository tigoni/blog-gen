The town was Soflin and Jola had been born there some thirty years ago. Although if someone had asked him Jola was not too sure about this exact date of birth as his mother had died before getting his birth certificate. He only knew these facts:</p><ul><li><p>He was of Pinesse origin</p></li><li><p>His father was a rinier at the state office of the Gos colony of the Biae empire.</p></li><li><p></p></li></ul><p>If he would have been asked to write some code for these facts, it would have possibly been something like:</p><pre>module JolaPin where
  origin :: Pinesse
  parentJob :: Rinier
